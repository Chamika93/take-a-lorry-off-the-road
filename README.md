# Take a Lorry off the Road With Some Code!
This [code kata](http://codekata.com/) was inspired by a feature we implemented recently which allowed us to send [1 less lorry out for delivery](https://medium.com/gousto-engineering-techbrunch/taking-a-lorry-off-the-road-with-some-code-a988f70b37c1) every single day! We call this feature **Intelligent Packaging.** We'd like you to build something similar.

For the pairing exercise, see PAIRING.md. For the take-home test, see TAKE-HOME.md.
